      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          I live in Utah and Im 25 years old. Immediatly after highschool I started college. I had no idea what I wanted to
          do and after taking nearly 40 classes ranging from business management to diesel mechanics, I finally dropped out. I went to work in a local
          coal mine and worked as mechanic there for 3 years. I was able to advance my knowledge and become a certified underground electrician.
          I loved the work but it was very difficult and while I was in a slump for about a month that I felt I would never get out of
          I decided to leave and puruse a new career. I began administrative work for a commercial realestate magazine called Propmodo.
          I have now worked there for 3 years and they are paying my way through this web development program. Im very excited to be
          learning here and advancing my knowledge.

          I really enjoy outdoor activites. Im a very avid mountain bike rider and began racing downhill when I was 8 years old. I've enjoyeed
          that sport all my life. I've recently got into rock climbing which im enjoying a lot! I quickly progressed with this being my first
          year climbing and I was able to successfully climb my first 5.12 just last month. I look forward to learning how to ice climb as well.
          I originally got into rock climbing because I thought it would be a great entry to get good rope skills so that I can do some more extreme
          mountaineering. Summer 2023 I plan to summit Rainier with friend of mine. Following that I hope to climb the matterhorn in 2023 as well.
          If finances are available I will then plan to summit Acongagua in Argentina during the winter of 2023. I would eventually like to do Denali 
          and Everest. I also like to read. I started slowly collecting rare old books like first editions of Hemmingway and old religious works.
